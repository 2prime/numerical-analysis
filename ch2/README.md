# Chapter 2: Polynomial Interpolation and Approximation

This chapter basically contains:

Polynomial interpolation:
- Lagrange interpolation
- Newton interpolation
- Piecewise linear interpolation
- Hermite interpolation
- Cubic spline interpolation
- (B-spline interpolation)

Polynomial approximation:
- (Uniform approximation)
- Least squares approximation
- (Pad√© approximation)

Stuff in brackets are not implemented.
