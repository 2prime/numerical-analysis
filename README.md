# Numerical Analysis
This repository stores all my codes for the Numerical Analysis Course, and is basically composed of the following seven chapters:

- Chapter 1: Introduction
- Chapter 2: Polynomial Interpolation and Approximation
- Chapter 3: Numerical Differentiation and Integration
- Chapter 4: Numerical Methods for Non-linear Equations
- Chapter 5: Fast Fourier Transform
- Chapter 6: Numerical Methods for Ordinary Differential Equations
- Chapter 7: Monte-Carlo Methods

Most of them are implemented in Python with only one exception, FFT in Chapter 5, which uses C++ to implement from scratch. Auxillary methods, say linear equation solver, are not included in these codes. Numerical reports (Chinese version) are also attached to illustrate the problem backgrounds and algorithm principles.
